1. Share backgrounds: It's nice to share backgrounds to break the ice and get to know the other person a bit better.

2. State expectations and goals:
  - What would you hope to get from the mentor? Maybe the application form can help here.
  - What would the mentor expect from the mentee?
  - What are you hoping to gain from this relationship? Ask the other person the same thing.
  - Where would you like to grow? Ask the other person the same thing.
  - The best mentorships are two-way streets, where both people get something out of it.

3. Define topics to work on (long-term): What areas are you interested in?

4. Short-term wins (if any): What is an area you'd like to grow in the next month? Let's start with focusing on that.

5. Define ways of working: Given all the available tools for mentoring what are the ones that better apply to this specific mentor-mentee relationship: Project Zenith | Tools for mentors: how can mentors help mentees to grow.

6. Define cadence of catch-ups: How often should we follow up and when? I've seen most developers catch up once every two weeks for half an hour or and hour, at a time that works for both of them, e.g., sometimes over lunch.

6. Define communication style between catch-ups: Would the mentor be open to random pings? What is their schedule like?

7. Define how to evaluate progress: What criteria would help to assess how efficient this mentorship is? What weaknesses do you believe you can work on that can help us assess the success of the mentorship?

8. Expected challenges to the mentorship program: It's nice to lay out things that might make this relationship hard. For example, it's okay to share with your to-be-mentor that you have no clue how mentorship works. Or your mentor might share how they have a crazy next month, and they will be swamped.
